# FPGA-Projects:

Example - LED 01/02: Using counter to change state(lr and rr) and display output by LED

Example - Button 03/04/05: Add input (FPGA button) to change state and display output by LED(and divide project to multiple projects, divide and conquer.)

Example - PWM 06/07: By adjusting pulse ratio to change the brightness of LED.

Example - UART_TXRX 07/08/09/10/11: Using UART to transmit/receive data

Example - I2C 12: Using I2C to transmit / receive data

Example: - SPI_LCD 13: Using SPI to transmit / receive data and display output by LCD screen.
